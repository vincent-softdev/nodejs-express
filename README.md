# KEY CONCEPTS APPLIED

1. MVC: Model View Controller pattern - separates request handling, business logic, and data access.
2. Service Layer: Centralises business logic for better code reusability.
3. Repository Pattern: Abstracts database queries for flexibility.
4. Middleware Pattern: Handle authentication, logging, error handling, and validation in a modular way.
5. S.O.L.I.D principle:
- Single Responsibility -> Each module has one responsibility.
- Open / Closed -> New features can be added without modifying existing code.
- Liskov Substitution -> Services can be replaced with alternative implementations.
- Interface Segregation -> Controllers only depend on what they need.
- Dependency Inversion -> Services and repositories are injected as dependencies.
